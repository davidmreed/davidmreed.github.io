I am a Salesforce administrator and developer at the [Santa Fe Institute](http://www.santafe.edu). (I do not speak on SFI's behalf: opinions and mistakes are my own).
I am also Head of Officials at [Duke City Roller Derby](http://dukecityderby.com).
My other areas of interest include Ancient Greek, Plato, botanical gardens, and cryptography.
