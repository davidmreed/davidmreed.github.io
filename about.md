title: About
---

I am a 7x certified Salesforce engineer based on Philadelphia. I work full time in the financial services industry, and I'm available for part-time [consulting engagements]({{site.baseurl}}/consulting) on small to midsize projects. In addition to the full breadth of platform development, I have strong interests in Salesforce for nonprofit organizations, building tools in Python, and devops and development lifecycle management.

You can find me at [david@ktema.org](mailto:david@ktema.org); [@aoristdual](https://twitter.com/aoristdual); on [Salesforce Stack Exchange](https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/users/46017/david-reed); on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-reed-16175b31); and as [davidmreed](https://github.com/davidmreed) on GitHub.

## Projects

My GitHub is [`davidmreed`](https://github.com/davidmreed). Additional project notes are under [Code]({{site.baseurl}}/code) or at GitHub itself; here are a few highlights:
  - A [Lightning transit tracker application](https://github.com/davidmreed/septaTrains) (if you live in Philadelphia, you can see your SEPTA regional rail trains on your Lightning homepage!) that I use as a demonstration of CI, automated testing, and toolchain design.
  - A [library](https://github.com/davidmreed/DMRNoteAttachmentImporter) for doing bulk data loads of `ContentNote` and `ContentVersion` records.
  - A [Python tool](https://github.com/davidmreed/fix15) for converting Salesforce Ids in CSV files.
  - [Demonstrations and example configuration files](https://github.com/davidmreed/circleci-sfdx-examples) for different continuous integration workflows with Salesforce DX, CircleCI, and [Python `simple_salesforce`](https://github.com/davidmreed/sfdx-simplesalesforce).

## Presentations

I've spoken several times on continuous integration and Salesforce DX. You can find my talks on YouTube, and articles I've written on this subject are available on this website.
