I am a 5x Salesforce-certified [developer and administrator](http://certification.salesforce.com/verification-email?init=1&email=david@ktema.org) with deep experience implementing, customizing, and integrating Salesforce. I love to build effective, expressive, and flexible systems that support the way people really work. I'm happy to discuss how I can help create your robust, solution-oriented CRM.

Services I provide include application development, customization, implementation of AppExchange solutions, data import and cleaning, migration into Salesforce, and integration with external systems. Please [get in touch](mailto:david@ktema.org). I look forward to chatting about how we can accomplish your objectives, and I'd be happy to share case studies and client references.

## Contact

I can be reached any time at [david@ktema.org](david@ktema.org). I'm located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and happy to work with organizations anywhere. I am currently available on a part-time basis.

## Technologies

I'm fluent with all of the core Salesforce technologies, including Apex, Visualforce, Lightning, JavaScript, SOQL and SOSL, high data volume processing, batch and queueable asynchronous code, and REST and JSON services. I use the latest development technologies, including Salesforce DX. And I have experience applying the Salesforce Data Loader and other ETL tools - including fully custom solutions written in Python - to integrate, process, and transform Salesforce data.

I always deliver thoroughly tested, documented, and maintainable code. It's a point of pride. For examples of my work, please review my Code page, or drop me a line. I hold the Platform Developer II certification (Salesforce's highest developer credential) and I'll always work with you to ensure your solution is ready to grow and evolve with your organization.

## Nonprofit

Long experience on the ground raising funds, writing proposals, and planning events has given me a thorough understanding of nonprofit needs and where technology can make a difference. In addition to fully custom solutions built using Apex, Visualforce, and other Salesforce technologies, I have expertise in the Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack, NGO Connect, Click & Pledge, Volunteers for Salesforce, MailChimp, DrawLoop, and other prominent solutions. And I have a demonstrated ability to connect technology with process, creating integrated systems that save hours and deliver results.

I'd be delighted to help your nonprofit organization advance your mission with Salesforce.
