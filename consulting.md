As a [Salesforce-certified developer and administrator](http://certification.salesforce.com/verification-email?init=1&email=david@ktema.org) with deep experience in nonprofit operations and fundraising, I am uniquely qualified to take on the challenges of creating a robust and solution-oriented CRM using Salesforce. I love to build effective, expressive, and flexible systems that support the way people really work, and I'm happy to discuss your Salesforce objectives any time. Please reach out at [david@ktema.org](mailto:david@ktema.org).

Long experience on the ground raising funds, writing proposals, and planning events has given me a thorough understanding of nonprofit needs and where technology can make a difference. In addition to fully custom solutions built using Apex, Visualforce, and other Salesforce technologies, I have expertise in the Salesforce Nonprofit Success Pack, NGO Connect, Click & Pledge, Volunteers for Salesforce, MailChimp, DrawLoop, and other prominent solutions. And I have a demonstrated ability to connect technology with process, creating integrated systems that save hours and deliver results.

Services I provide include application development, customization, implementation of AppExchange solutions, data import and cleaning, migration, and integration with external systems.

Whether you're looking for new development or enhancement of an existing solution, I'd be delighted to help you advance your mission. Please [get in touch](mailto:david@ktema.org). I look forward to chatting about how we can accomplish your objectives, and I'd be happy to share case studies I've worked on.
