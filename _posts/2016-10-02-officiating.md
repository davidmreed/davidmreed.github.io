I'm very happy to have been elected to another year as Head of Officials for my roller derby league, 
[Duke City Roller Derby](http://www.dukecityderby.com/). I think we've made a lot of progress in 2016 and I'm 
grateful that DCRD took a chance on me, then a very new NSO, last year.

It's been a busy and exhilarating year. I've officiated 51 games in six states, participated in 3 tournaments, 
traveled (by a back-of-the-envelope reckoning) something on the order of 10,000 miles, met tons of fantastic people, and had a great time. 
My personal goal for 2017 is to join at least two higher-level tournaments and aim for WFTDA certification.
