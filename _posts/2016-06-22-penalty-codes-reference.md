title: WFTDA Penalty Codes and Verbal Cues Reference
---

In the course of working with a new Penalty Tracker for an upcoming mock sanctioned bout,
I realized that I could not find a good reference to the WFTDA penalty codes and verbal cues
that included 2016's new penalties (Leaping Contact [my favorite verbal cue] et al).

Here is my stab at the problem: [WFTDA Verbal Cues and Penalty Codes Reference]({{site.baseurl}}/public/WFTDA Verbal Cues and Penalty Codes Reference.pdf)

The PDF has two pages, the first ordered by verbal cue and the second by penalty code.
Please feel free to use, share, and modify.
