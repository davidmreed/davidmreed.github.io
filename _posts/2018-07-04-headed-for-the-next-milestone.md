title: Headed for the Next Milestone 
---

For 2018, I've set my sights on becoming a Salesforce Certified Application Architect. (My 2017 goal was Platform Developer II, which I did complete). To reach Application Architect, I need three certifications: Sharing and Visibility Designer, Data Architecture and Management Designer, and App Builder. 

Yesterday, I passed the first milestone: Certified Sharing and Visibility Designer, my first architect-tier certification.

It was a challenging exam and pushed me to study and implement a number of areas of functionality, like Territory Management, with which I hadn't previously gotten hands-on experience. I'm excited to tackle Data Architecture and Management Designer for the second half of the year.
