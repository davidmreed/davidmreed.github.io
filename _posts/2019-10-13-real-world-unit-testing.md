title: "Real-World Unit Testing: Get to 100% Coverage, the Right Way"
---

My presentation from PhillyForce '19, "Real-World Unit Testing: Get to 100% Coverage, the Right Way", is now [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkjTDxbYPgY). It was a great experience to return to PhillyForce as a speaker and organizing committee member to talk about one of the subjects I'm most passionate about - automated testing - and make the case that writing good unit tests is actually a moral, not just a technical, imperative.

The talk covers four big headings:

- Thinking about tests as promises we're making, and how that changes the focus of a testing program.
- Writing good unit tests in Apex.
- Writing testable code, thinking about tests as API consumers, and using tests to guide refactoring.
- Advanced testing strategies with mocking and dependency injection for working with complex asynchronous Apex.
