title: "Amaxa: A Multi-Object Data Loader for Salesforce"
---

I've just released [Amaxa](https://gitlab.com/davidmreed/amaxa), an open-source project I've been working on for several months. Amaxa is a multi-object ETL tool/data loadder for Salesforce. It's designed to extract and load whole networks of records, like a selected set of Accounts with all of their Contacts, Opportunities, Contact Roles, and Campaigns, in a single repeatable operation while preserving the relationships between those records.

Core use cases for Amaxa include sandbox seeding, data migration, and retrieving connected data sets. The current release of Amaxa is version v0.9.2, in beta. Feedback and bug reports, via GitLab Issues, are welcome. There's a lot more to come.

Amaxa is built in Python with Salesforce DX, `simple_salesforce`, and `salesforce_bulk`. Instructions and examples are included in the GitLab repository.
