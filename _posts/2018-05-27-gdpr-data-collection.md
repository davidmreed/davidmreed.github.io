title: In Response to 10,000 GDPR Emails
---

Over the last week or two, every website in the known universe has sent us all emails about the GDPR and the vast scope of what data they collect and what they do with it. As a tiny response to this trend, I've gone the other direction: I've removed all analytics from `ktema.org`. 

While I cannot speak for my hosting and infrastructure services (GitHub and Cloudflare), this site collects no information at all, sets no cookies, maintains no logs of any kind, and knows nothing at all about you. Because really, why would it need to?
