title: Leveling Up for the New Year

One of my biggest goals for 2017 was to pass the Salesforce Platform Developer II certification. I'm thrilled to say that I completed the brand-new certification path over the holidays. Platform Developer II was a very challenging (and fun!) exam that made me stretch myself in deep corners of the Salesforce platform.

It's very exciting to hit this threshold on Salesforce, and I'm eager to start work on the next big challenge.
