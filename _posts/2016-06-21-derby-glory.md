My league, Duke City Roller Derby, let me use this month's spotlight to talk about
officiating and how much fun it is.

When I accepted the nomination for Head of Officials,
I was told it would take a couple of hours a week. This might be true if I didn't
say 'yes' to every game and tournament within driving range (and a few that aren't).

I really can't complain, though; I'm having a great time.
