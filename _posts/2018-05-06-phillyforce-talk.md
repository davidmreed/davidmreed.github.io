title: "Continuous Integration with Salesforce DX: Practices and Principles for All"
---

Last week, I had the pleasure of giving a talk on continuous integration with Salesforce DX and CircleCI at PhillyForce '18. The talk built upon past work I've shared here, including:

 - [Salesforce Lifecycle and Tooling: CircleCI and SFDX]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-02-salesforce-dx-circleci %})
 - [Integrating Static Analysis with PMD in the Salesforce Development Lifecycle]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-08-static-analysis-pmd-salesforce %})
 - [Salesforce Lifecycle and Tooling: Testing on Multiple Org Types with Salesforce DX and CircleCI Workflows]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-17-circleci-sfdx-multiple-org-shapes %})
 - [Integration Testing Off-Platform Code with Salesforce DX and `simple_salesforce`]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-03-27-integration-testing-salesforce-dx-simple-salesforce %})

The full video will be on YouTube in the future. In the meantime, have a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/davidmreed/circleci-sfdx-examples), which includes all of the example CircleCI workflows and source code from the talk.
