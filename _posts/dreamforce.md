Dreamforce this year was a fantastic experience. 

 - I came home with two certifications, Platform Developer I and Administrator. 
 - My talk with Adam Kramer, [Staying on Top of Salesforce & NPSP Releases](https://success.salesforce.com/MyAgenda?eventId=a1Q3000000qQOd9EAG#/session/a2q3A000001x60dQAA), 
had a nice reception, and I got to chat with some excellent nonprofit Salesforce users.
 - I learned a ton of new techniques for writing generic and dynamic Apex code, using mocks and stubs to build better unit tests, 
implementing continuous integration, and practicing modern development on the Salesforce platform.

I can't wait to go back.
