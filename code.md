## [DMRNoteAttachmentImporter](https://github.com/davidmreed/DMRNoteAttachmentImporter) — note and attachment importing support for Salesforce

This source-only package provides Apex support for easily adding notes and attachments (using the new content library objects) to Salesforce records, as well as bulk note importing. It abstracts the complex content preparation required and helps to avoid unpredictable `ContentNote` exceptions.

## [Trapeza](https://github.com/davidmreed/trapeza) and [Trapeza-Import](https://github.com/davidmreed/trapeza-import)

These Python-based tools are designed to facilitate the manipulation and combination of record data in tabular form -
in particular, CSV files containing database output. Trapeza-Import is designed to streamline the importing of large amounts
of records into a database by matching duplicates in user-configurable ways. Originally designed for use with Blackbaud Raiser's Edge.

## [bouncingbots](https://github.com/davidmreed/bouncingbots) — a *Ricochet Robots* Solver

This C library implements a simulation and solver for the board game [Ricochet Robots](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=163). Included are the library,
a command-line tool and a rudimentary Mac OS X interface. Supply a board layout, in a fairly simple
text format or using the GUI tool, and `bouncingbots` will offer a list of solutions.

## Inactive Projects

I am no longer an active Macintosh developer, so all Mac code should be considered unmaintained.
Please contact me if you're interested in taking over a project.

### iMan — a Cocoa manpage viewer.

[Download](https://github.com/davidmreed/iman/releases/download/0.4/iMan0.4.zip), [Source](https://github.com/davidmreed/iman)

iMan is a GUI application designed to replace the terminal `man(1)` program.
iMan offers a browser-inspired interface to the system manpages with fast display and searching,
UTF-8 support, caching, and other features. I no longer actively develop this project.
