### [Trapeza](https://github.com/davidmreed/trapeza) and [Trapeza-Import](https://github.com/davidmreed/trapeza-import)

These Python-based tools are designed to facilitate the manipulation and combination of record data in tabular form -
in particular, CSV files containing database output. Trapeza-Import is designed to streamline the importing of large amounts
of records into a database by matching duplicates in user-configurable ways. Originally designed for use with Blackbaud Raiser's Edge.

### [bouncingbots](https://github.com/davidmreed/bouncingbots) â€” a *Ricochet Robots* Solver

This C library implements a simulation and solver for the board game [Ricochet Robots](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=163). Included are the library, a command-line tool and a rudimentary Mac OS X interface. Supply a board layout, in a fairly simple
text format or using the GUI tool, and `bouncingbots` will offer a list of solutions.

## Inactive Projects

I am no longer an active Macintosh developer, so all Mac code should be considered unmaintained.
Please contact me if you're interested in taking over a project.

### [iMan](https://github.com/davidmreed/iman)

iMan is a a Cocoa manpage viewer designed to replace the terminal `man(1)` program.
iMan offers a browser-inspired interface to the system manpages with fast display and searching,
UTF-8 support, caching, and other features. I no longer actively develop this project.
