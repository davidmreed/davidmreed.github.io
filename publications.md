title: Talks & Publications
---

I've given many talks on Salesforce, mostly focusing on topics like Apex testing, continuous integration, CumulusCI, Salesforce DX, and version control. I love meeting with Salesforce groups to teach and advocate in these areas. If your group is looking for content in these areas, please drop me a line.

## Publications

- [Build Applications with CumulusCI](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/trails/build-applications-with-cumulusci), a six-module trail on Trailhead (coauthored).

## Presentations on CumulusCI Suite

I've visited a number of conferences and user groups to present on how to automate Salesforce development using CumulusCI. You can view recordings of presentations on "Automate the App Lifecycle with CumulusCI" from [Virtual Dreamin' 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoLiVbYFdKA), the [London Salesforce Developers Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KG9tCYlgmA), the [Kitchener, Canada Developers Group](https://www.sudipta-deb.in/2020/04/kitchener-canada-developer-group-event.html) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Guc8ZX1Dg6A)), at [ApexHours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBuyAkE3-h8), and in [Denver, Colorado](https://zoom.us/rec/play/tMJ8f7qsrTM3SYbD5QSDA6UqW47rLa6s1SRNqfcNyhm2UHIGZAKnb-EaN-o-6ntWanpaVfngazZMehC1?continueMode=true) ([slides](https://www.ktema.org/public/cumulusci/Automate_the_App_Lifecycle_with_CumulusCI.pdf)). I've also spoken to developer groups in the Netherlands; Munich, Germany; Mount Laurel, New Jersey; and Moscow, Russia.
