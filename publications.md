I've given a number of talks on Salesforce, mostly focusing on topics like Apex testing, continuous integration, CumulusCI, Salesforce DX, and version control. I love meeting with Salesforce groups to teach and advocate in these areas. If your group is looking for content in these areas, please drop me a line.
